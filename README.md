## Hello, World!

I'm Thiri, an undergraduate Computer Science student and undergraduate researcher deeply passionate about quantum technologies and theoretical physics. Currently, I'm immersed in the captivating realm of quantum computing through the Qubit by Qubit program and quantum software engineering boot camp. Beyond my academic curriculum, I dedicate my spare moments to delving into the depths of quantum mechanics, exploring graduate-level theoretical physics courses from Perimeter Institute and MITOCW. In my GitHub repositories, you can explore a comprehensive list of free learning resources that I am curating along my learning journey to foster a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics. 

**Prior experiences in**: C, Python, Java, MATLAB, LaTeX, Qiskit, Cirq
