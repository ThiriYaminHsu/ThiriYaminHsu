## Hello, World!

I'm Thiri, an undergraduate Computer Science student deeply passionate about theoretical physics. Currently, I'm immersed in the captivating realm of quantum computing through the Qubit by Qubit program. Beyond my academic curriculum, I dedicate my spare moments to delving into the depths of quantum mechanics, exploring graduate-level theoretical physics courses from Perimeter Institute and MITOCW. In my GitHub repositories you can explore a comprehensive list of free learning resources that I am curating along my learning journey to foster a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics. 

**Prior experiences in**: C, Python, Java, MATLAB, LaTeX, Qiskit, Cirq
